# OctoAcme — Retrospective & Continuous Improvement

## Purpose
Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements.

## When
After each sprint, release, or important milestone. Also after incidents.

## Structure
- What went well
- What could be improved
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Follow-up on previous action items

## Running a Retrospective
Project Manager facilitates with input from all roles (see [Roles & Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md)):
- Timebox: 45–75 minutes depending on team size
- Invite all core roles: PM, PdM, Developers, and supporting roles as relevant (Release Manager, QA Lead, UX Designer, Support Lead)
- Use an anonymous idea board if needed to encourage candor
- Prioritize 2–3 top action items to avoid overload
- Ensure each role can share perspective (quality, design, support, release process)

## Tracking Improvements
- Add action items to the project backlog or issues with clear owners and timelines
- Review outstanding actions in the weekly PM sync

## Example Action Item Template

- Description:

## Continuous Improvement Culture
- Measure impact of action items
- Celebrate improvements and make small, iterative changes
- Cross-functional insights drive better processes:
  - Release Manager shares deployment learnings
  - QA Lead identifies quality gaps and test coverage improvements
  - UX Designer highlights usability issues and design process feedback
  - Support Lead provides customer pain points and documentation needs
