# OctoAcme â€” Project Planning

## Purpose
Turn an approved initiative into an actionable plan and backlog for delivery.

## Objectives
- Break work into shippable increments
- Identify dependencies and risks
- Align timelines, releases, and responsibilities

## Activities
1. Kickoff meeting with stakeholders and delivery team (PM, PdM, Tech Lead, and supporting roles as needed)
2. Create prioritized backlog with acceptance criteria
3. Estimate scope (T-shirt sizing or story points)
4. Define Definition of Done (DoD) including quality and design standards
5. Identify dependencies and integration points
6. Create release plan and milestone map (with Release Manager if applicable)
7. Define quality strategy and test approach (with QA Lead)
8. Review design scope and user research needs (with UX Designer if UI/UX work)
9. Assess customer impact and support readiness needs (with Support Lead for customer-facing features)

See [Roles & Personas](octoacme-roles-and-personas.md) for detailed role responsibilities and handoffs.
